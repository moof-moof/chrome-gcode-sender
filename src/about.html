  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>gcode-sender</strong> is a chrome application capable of sending <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gcode" target="_blank">gcode</a> commands to a USB gcode intrepreter like <a href="https://github.com/gnea/grbl" target="_blank">Grbl</a>.

    The source code and documentation for gcode-sender are available on github (<a href="https://github.com/sir-buckyball/chrome-gcode-sender" target="_blank">https://github.com/sir-buckyball/chrome-gcode-sender</a>).
    <p>
    </p>
    Actually, this implementation is <b>GeeSaw Feeder</b>, a fork of the above application, which is preferably locally stored and loaded. <BR>
    Its glorious <i>raison d'Ãªtre</i> is to be a bespoke X-Y (2D) data sender for a little-known grbl-based CNC scroll-saw machine called <strong>"GeeSaw"</strong>.
